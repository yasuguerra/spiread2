git describe --exact-match --tags HEAD
# Should output: v1.0.0

# 2. Check debug endpoint locally
curl -s http://localhost:3000/debug | jq '.goNoGo.version'
# Should output: "1.0.0"

# 3. Verify Service Worker version
curl -s http://localhost:3000/sw.js | head -1

# Run smoke tests
npx playwright test tests/smoke/prod-smoke.spec.js
```

### Manual Testing Scenarios

#### PWA Installation & Offline Testing
1. **Install PWA:**
   - Visit `https://app.spiread.com` in Chrome/Edge
   - Click install prompt or browser menu â†’ "Install Spiread"
   - Verify app appears in applications/desktop

2. **Offline Functionality:**
   - Open installed PWA
   - Enable airplane mode / disconnect network
   - Try to play any game (should work offline)

## Observability & Monitoring

### Sentry Configuration
After deployment, verify Sentry is capturing errors:

```bash
# Trigger test error
curl -X POST https://app.spiread.com/api/observability/throw \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "test", "message": "Production deployment verification"}'

# Check Sentry dashboard for the error
# Verify sourcemaps resolve correctly
# Confirm no PII is captured
```

### Analytics Dashboard
- Verify events are appearing in Plausible/PostHog
- Check that consent is being respected
- Monitor key metrics:
  - Page views
  - Game completions
  - PWA installations
  - Session durations

### Alert Configuration
Set up alerts for:
- Error rate > 1%
- 5xx responses > 0.1%
- P95 response time > 2s
- PWA install rate drop > 50%
