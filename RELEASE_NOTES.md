## 🚨 Known Risks & Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **High Memory Usage**: Next.js compilation can consume significant memory
   - *Mitigation*: Automatic server restart on memory threshold approach
   - *Monitoring*: Server resource monitoring and alerting

2. **Service Worker Complexity**: Advanced caching and sync logic
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive fallback strategies and error handling
   - *Testing*: Extensive PWA testing across different network conditions

3. **Analytics Consent Complexity**: Multiple privacy regulations
   - *Mitigation*: Conservative approach with consent-first design
   - *Compliance*: Regular privacy policy reviews and updates

### Rollback Plan
1. **Database**: All migrations are reversible with down scripts
2. **Frontend**: Previous version assets maintained for 7 days
3. **Configuration**: Environment variables documented with fallbacks
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time error tracking for immediate issue detection

## 📋 How to Reproduce Offline + Background Sync

### Step-by-Step Offline Testing

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Open Spiread in browser
   # Go to Developer Tools > Network tab
   # Check "Offline" checkbox to simulate network disconnection
   ```

2. **Test Offline Game Play**
   - Navigate to any of the 9 games
   - Start a game session (games work completely offline)
   - Complete a 10-15 second session
   - Verify game functionality without internet

3. **Verify Background Sync Queue**
   ```bash
   # While still offline, check debug endpoint:
   curl http://localhost:3000/debug
   # Look for pwa.bgSync.queueLengths with pending items
   ```

4. **Test Background Sync**
   - Re-enable network connection
   - Wait 2-3 seconds for automatic sync
   - Check debug endpoint again to verify queue is empty
   - Verify game runs appear in database

5. **Validate Service Worker**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(registration => {
     console.log('SW Status:', registration.active.state);
   });
   ```

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Games load and function completely offline
- ✅ Game progress is saved locally while offline
- ✅ Data syncs automatically when connection resumes
- ✅ No data loss during offline periods
- ✅ User receives feedback about sync status
